# AVRNetIOduino
This hack is based on different internet sources to actually use the Arduino IDE also on a Pollin AVR NetIO board available as kit for just 20 Euros; see [www.pollin.de](http://www.pollin.de). This enables a rather cheap variant of the Arduino plus Ethernet option.

The bootloader source file is taken from the Arduino 1.0.2 sources and is enhanced to work also with both an Atmel ATmega644P and ATmega32 microcontroller on the Pollin AVR NetIO board.

Additionally I altered one AVRNetIO board work with an ATmega644P on 3.3V only.

I performed successful test using the AVRNetIO w/ ATmega32 and 644P and Jean-Claude Wippler's EtherCard implementation; note to change the select pin of the ethercard examples from default 8 to 4 (PB4 - better use the global variable SS).

AVRNetIO works also fine using UIPEthernet by Norbert Truchsess; see

There are surely different sources that did the same adaptation already; but after fiddling two days with the Sanguino bootloader code and not succeeding (device ID not read?!), I tried to enhance the original Arduino bootloader from scratch and by that learn about its behavior - this I may recommend to everybody trying also to understand what happens here.

## Using the AVRNetIO hardware in the Arduino IDE

Copy the [/AVRNetIO/](AVRNetIO/) folder into the Arduino's hardware folder; use an LED on the J11 jumper header to see bootloader activity (LEDpin in this case is  "1"); this I made a permanent fix by changing resistor R13 from 10k to 1k and soldering in an LED with anode in the hole marked as "normal" and cathode in the center hole of jumper J11 - LED active is on LOW though. Be aware that the Arduino IDE is constantly changed (not always to the better), so, please check for the ReadMe file and copy additional folders from the original Arduino hardware folders, if necessary - I currently get IDE v1.6.5 not writing to the AVRNetIO board, so keep using an old v1.0.5 IDE and this files' version as of commit [75e329](75e32968b6504dd975674b5d2d65d24a27c60544).

See [/AVRNetIO_rbbb_server/](AVRNetIO_rbbb_server/) for an easy webserver enabling switching Outputs 1 to 8, getting Inputs 1 to 4, and readings from ADC 1 to 4.

See [/AVRNetIO_MQTT/](AVRNetIO_MQTT/) for a very basic implementation of MQTT publishing to the [Fluksometer's MQTT broker](http://www.flukso.net) (or any other broker) to display port readings.

See [/AVRNetIO_MQTT_DS/](AVRNetIO_MQTT_DS/) to publish temperature data from Dallas DS18x20 sensors

For an ATmega644P use following fuse settings:

<table>
<tr><td>Fuse HIGH</td><td>0xDC</td><td>JTAG disable, Bootloader active with size 1024 words</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fuse LOW</td><td>0xE0</td><td>No clock divider, external clock source for feeding from ENC28J60</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fuse Extended</td><td>0xFF</td><td>default setting</td></tr>
</table>

for an ATmega32 set fuses to `HIGH = 0xCA` and `LOW = 0xFF`.

The code is under the given sources license.
